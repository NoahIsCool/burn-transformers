## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Backend-generic causal and encoder-decoder inference contracts for Burn.
- Strict, local-only sharded SafeTensors discovery and streaming installation
  with deterministic tensor-level load reports.
- External preallocated KV, recurrent, compressed-latent, sliding-window, and
  cross-attention cache state.
- Tokenization, chat-template rendering, causal generation, and T5 beam search
  behind optional features.
- Modular implementations of normalization, position encodings, attention,
  recurrent mixers, dense feed-forward networks, and sparse experts.
- Experimental model-family implementations and native Q4/Q8 Burnpack tooling;
  exact advertised checkpoint support remains governed by the committed
  acceptance records rather than by architecture presence alone.
